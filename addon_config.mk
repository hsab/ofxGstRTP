	ADDON_DESCRIPTION = Addon for sending video, audio, depth and osc to a remote peer using RTP. It can also use ofxXMPP to initiate the session through google talk, jabber or any other xmpp compatible server so you don't need to know the IP of the remote end. It can also use ofxNice to do NAT transversal so you can send data from computers behind NAT routers. Requires gstreamer to work.
